                    Humanity’s ultimate dream in the battle of cancer may be to find one successful treatment in dealing with all types of cancer, a dream that seems to be on a date with a big step on the road to achieving it, according to a study published in Nature Immunology. A team of researchers at <strong><q>Cardiff University</q></strong>  was able to discover a type of killer T immune cell that has a new type of receptor that can identify and kill most types of cancer cells without harming healthy cells, which opens new horizons for treating many types of cancer. <br>
                    Anti-cancer <u>T-cell</u> therapies - which include removing and modifying immune cells and returning them to a patient's blood to search for and destroy cancer cells - are the latest model in advanced cancer treatments. <br>
                    The most widely used type is known as <i>CAR-T</i>, and it is specific to each patient, but it targets a limited number of cancers, and has not been successful in treating the solid tumors that make up the majority of cancers. Conventional T cells scan the surface of other cells, to find what appears anomalous to eliminate cancer cells, while ignoring cells that only contain <q>normal</q>
                    proteins, and the scan identifies small parts of cellular proteins associated with cell surface molecules, called <strong><q>Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)</q></strong>, which allows killer T cells to see what is happening inside cells by scanning their surface. <br>
                    The new type recognizes a molecule called <strong><q>MR1</q></strong> that is present on the surface of a wide range of cancer cells and normal cells, and is able to distinguish between healthy and cancerous cells, by killing only the latter, which qualifies it to be a target for more immunotherapy treatments. <br>
                    The researchers discovered that this type of T cells found in the blood can recognize and destroy many types of cancer cells and attack many types of cancer, and the idea of ​​the new study is to take a sample from the blood of a cancer patient, then the T cells are extracted from the sample, modified genetically and reprogrammed from In order to acquire a receptor capable of detecting cancer, then the modified cells are grown in ample numbers in the laboratory before being re-injected into the patient.
                    It is the same method used in the <u>CAR-T</u> program, which is a cancer immunotherapy that includes genetic modification of T cells to stimulate the immune system to recognize and destroy specific cancers.
